### Instructions

The full results of the manuscript can be reproduced by running scripts 
- NZ09_figures
- NZ10_species_statistical_analyses
- NZ11_spatial_statistical_analyses

The raw results needed to run these scripts are already uploaded, so there is no need
to run the previous scripts. These previous scripts (NZ_01 to NZ_08) generate intermediate data and raw results, and are numbered sequentially 
to show the complete workflow. 

Some of the raw results (e.g. the communicability of each local population, from NZ07)
are quite costly to obtain and generate a large amount of data, so they are not included in this upload.
Therefore, some of the scripts will not run as it is, in particular NZ08.

#### Important note
We are not allowed to share the raw occurrence data of plants and birds from Tier1 and the National Vegetation Survey, 
so we share the modeled co-occurrences from the Joint Species Distribution Model fed with these data (NZ04_clear_model_occurrences).
Furthermore, we share the code to generate the JSDM results, for completeness. Note, of course, that
without the original data, it will not work. This workflow is in files NZ04_01 to NZ04_05. It includes exporting models
to processing in a High Performance Cluster, so even with the original data, it would not be directly reproducible.

Supplementary results, in particular for simulated metacommunities, are generated by scripts with prefix "sim".

### Additional information

These results were generated using R 4.3 in Ubuntu 20.04, but should be agnostic to the operating system, as long as it is compatible with R 4.3. Running times in a standard computer, besides the script NZ07, are in the order of minutes. Package dependencies are explicited in each individual script.
