propagation of disturbances in spatial ecological networks

Note: the full results of the manuscript can be reproduced by running scripts 
- NZ09_figures
- NZ10_species_statistical_analyses
- NZ11_spatial_statistical_analyses

The raw results needed to run these scripts are already uploaded, so there is no need
to run the previous scripts. These previous scripts (NZ_01 to NZ_08) generate intermediate data and raw results, and are numbered sequentially 
to show the complete workflow. 

Some of the raw results (e.g. the communicability of each local population, from NZ07)
are quite costly to obtain and generate a large amount of data, so they are not included in this upload.
Therefore, some of the scripts will not run as it is, in particular NZ08.

We are not allowed to share the raw occurrence data from Tier1 and the National Vegetation Survey, so we share
the modeled co-occurrences from the Joint Species Distribution Model fed with these data (NZ04).
